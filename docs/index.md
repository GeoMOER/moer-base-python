#  Motivation
A life without the free programming language Python is no longer imaginable for many people and those who do not know Python often do not know what they are missing.
Unfortunately, the widespread believe that Python is difficult to learn still exists,
which makes it unnecessarily difficult for many newcomers to enter the world of Python.
We would like to change this with this course.

# Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

* set up and operate a Python development environment for data-driven tasks;
* use and distinguish basic data types and variables to structure and process information effectively;
* apply string manipulation and fundamental operators to work with textual and numeric data;
* control program flow using conditional statements and loops;
* structure and manage data using Python's built-in object data types such as lists, arrays, and data frames;
* read, process, and organize external data from CSV files for analysis;
* create simple and informative visualizations to explore and communicate data insights;
* understand and apply basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP);
