A life without the free programming language Python is no longer imaginable for many people and those who do not know Python often do not know what they are missing.
Unfortunately, the widespread believe that Python is difficult to learn still exists,
which makes it unnecessarily difficult for many newcomers to enter the world of Python.
We would like to change this with this course.




# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should

* know and understand the basic properties of an object-oriented programming language,
* flexibly use your knowledge and understanding in various programming contexts, and
* have the basic programming skills for working in more complex subject-specific projects.


# Course features

This course is intended as a blended learning module in the study program of the Department of Geography at the University of Marburg.
However, the provided units and spotlights can also be used independently.
