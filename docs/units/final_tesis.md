## üéØ Simple Tasks for Warm-up

### Task 1: Even and Odd Numbers *(5 p.)*

Write a program that loops through the numbers from 1 to 20 and prints whether each number is even or odd.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a loop from 1 to 20. *(2 p.)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use an if-else statement to check even or odd. *(2 p.)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Print each number with the label "even" or "odd". *(1 p.)*

---

### Task 2: Sum of Even Numbers *(6 p.)*

Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 1000.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a loop from 1 to 1000. *(2 p.)*

### Task 3: D3TD5T *(12 p.)*

Write a program that loops through a list (the list will be given next week).

- Create a loop.
- If the element is a number and divisible by 3, print "D3T" inside the loop.
- If the element is a number and divisible by 5, print "D5T" inside the loop.
- If the element is a number and divisible by both 3 and 5, print "D3TD5T" inside the loop and save it in a new list called d3td5t_list.
- If the element is a string, check its first character. If it is "U", save it in a new list called find_strings_U.
- Print all other numbers inside the loop.
- Finally, print the d3td5t_list and the find_strings_U list.

### üîç Task 6: Search for a last name in a DataFrame *(15 p.)*

**Description:**

In this task, you will practice iterating over a DataFrame and stopping a search as soon as a condition is met. This time, you will search only by last name.

**Preparation:**

- Create a string variable `my_lastname` containing your own last name.
- Create a boolean variable `found`, initialized as `False`.
- You will receive a CSV file with personal data next week. You do not need to create the DataFrame yourself!

**Steps:**
- Read the given DataFrame
- Find out which columns exist in the DataFrame.
- Loop through the DataFrame row by row.
- Check if the last name column in the current row matches `my_lastname`.
  - If a match is found, set `found = True` and **stop** the loop immediately.
- After the loop, check `found`:
  - If the last name was not found, print:  
    `No registration found for user {xxx}. You are not yet registered for the course "Base Python 2".`
  - Replace `{xxx}` with your actual `my_lastname` variable.

### Task 7: üé≤ Game ‚Äî "Lucky String Duel: You vs Computer" *(15 p.)*

**Description:**

In this advanced mini-game, you will play a "lucky string draw" duel against the computer!  
Imagine you both have access to a magical bag containing 100 surprise words stored in a DataFrame.

You will receive this DataFrame next week.  
Hint: Think carefully about how you access the word from the DataFrame!

**DataFrame Structure:**

- Column `Index`: 1 to 100
- Column `Word`: string values

**Steps:**
- Load the data
- Define all needed variables to store the scores and counters for you and for the computer.
- Define two separate loops: one for your turns and one for the computer's turns.
- In each loop, use a random "dice throw" (1‚Äì100) to select a word by index from the DataFrame, then calculate the results and update your counters:
  - Starts with "S" ‚Üí +1 p.
  - Starts with "St" ‚Üí +10 p.
  - Exactly "Strike" ‚Üí +100 p.
- Print all variables and counters clearly after both loops and the winner with a final message.

1Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 p.)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 p.)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ *(4 p.)*  
4Ô∏è‚É£ *(8 p.)*  
5Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 p.)*

### Task 8: üó∫Ô∏è "Visualizing the Largest Cities in Europe Based on Coordinates" *(15 p.)*

**Description:**

You will work with the `worldcities.csv` file (SimpleMaps).

**Instructions:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ You will receive the download link to the World Cities dataset next week.  
üëâ Use the **free version**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unzip and **note the path** to `worldcities.csv`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Load it into a pandas DataFrame and **print all column names**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Filter cities in Europe using:
- Latitude: 35¬∞ to 72¬∞ N.
- Longitude: -25¬∞ to 45¬∞ E.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Print the city names** from the filtered DataFrame.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sort the DataFrame by `population` in descending order.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **bar chart** (Matplotlib) for the top 10 largest cities:
- X-axis: City names.
- Y-axis: Population.
- Add a descriptive title, e.g., *"Top 10 Largest Cities in Europe (by Population)"*.

1Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 p.)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 p.)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ *(2 p.)*

## üí° Bonus Task: Object-Oriented Programming with Vehicles *(15 p.)*

**Description:**

Create a base class `Vehicle` with common attributes such as `color`, `year`, `engine`, `name`, and `model`.

---

**Subclasses:**

- **Car (PKW):**
  - Add a new attribute `type` (e.g., "limousine", "cabrio", "coupe").
  - Define a method `print_type()` that prints the car's type.

- **Truck (LKW):**
  - Add a new attribute `max_load_kg` that defines how many kilograms the truck can carry.
  - Define a method `print_max_load()` that prints this load capacity.

---

**Data:**

- You will receive **two CSV files next week**:
  - One file for cars (PKW), including an extra column `type`.
  - One file for trucks (LKW), including an extra column `max_load_kg`.

---

**Steps:**

- Define the base class `Vehicle` with attributes.
- Define the subclass `Car` with the extra attribute and method.
- Define the subclass `Truck` with the extra attribute and method.
- Load both CSV files into separate DataFrames.
- Create lists of `Car` and `Truck` objects from the respective DataFrames.
- Print how many vehicles were found in total and how many of them are "VW".
- Create a bar chart (Matplotlib) showing the number of cars and trucks per model for vehicles older than 2000.
- Add a legend with model names.

## Instruction summary
 
1. Please include a short description at the top of each script or function explaining what your code does and what is being calculated.
2. Inside your code, write meaningful comments to describe each important step, logic, and variable updates.
3. Clear comments help show your understanding, make your work easier to follow, and improve the overall quality of your code.
4. üö´ Do not copy any example code directly; always adapt it to your own logic and task requirements.

```python

"""
Description:
This program solves Task X from the thesis assignment.

It includes:
- A loop that processes a sequence or list.
- A condition to check certain properties of elements (e.g., number properties or string checks).
- Printing or saving specific results based on conditions.

Please adjust this description to fit your specific task and explain clearly what is being calculated.
"""

# Example of a loop (replace with your actual loop)
for item in my_list:
    # Check a condition (replace with your actual condition)
    if some_condition:
        # Add a comment explaining what happens here
        pass
    else:
        # Another comment for alternative case
        pass

# Finally, print or return results with a clear explanation
```

## üí¨ Note about comments

> ‚úçÔ∏è **Good comments are rewarded!**  
> For each task, you can receive an extra **0.5 points** for clear, well-structured comments.  
> These points are **not included in the main grade calculation**, but they can help you if you are just below a grade boundary.  
>  
> üí° For example: If you have 38 points (below passing level), but you wrote very good comments, you can receive enough extra points to pass (grade 4).  
>  
> üëâ So it is always worth it to write clear and meaningful comments!

## üí¨ Note about the Bonus Task

> ‚≠ê **The points you collect from the bonus task are not included in the main grade calculation.**  
> However, if your total points are just below a higher grade level, I will count your bonus task points to help you reach the better grade.  
>  
> It is completely your choice whether you want to try the bonus task or not ‚Äî but it can be a great opportunity to improve your final result!
