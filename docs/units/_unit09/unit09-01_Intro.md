Python is a fully object-oriented language, which means almost everything in Python is an object. OOP lets you:

- Group related data and functions together into **classes**.
- Create **objects** as specific instances of these classes.
- Use inheritance to build new classes based on existing ones.

In this unit, you'll learn how to create classes, define methods, and build more complex hierarchies using inheritance.
