# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects,” which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes), and code in the form of methods (functions). Python is a fully object-oriented language that makes it easy to design clean, modular, and reusable code.

## Why Learn OOP?

Understanding OOP allows you to:

- **Structure complex programs more clearly**
- **Reuse code efficiently** through inheritance and modular design
- **Model real-world systems** in a natural way
- **Collaborate** more easily with other developers in team projects

## Core Concepts of OOP

Here are the key principles you’ll learn in this unit:

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
   - An object is an instance of a class.

2. **Attributes and Methods**  
   - Attributes store information about the object.
   - Methods define behaviors or actions an object can perform.

3. **Encapsulation**
