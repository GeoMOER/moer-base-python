# Assignment

Extend the `Animal` class you created during the exercise.

## Tasks

### 1️⃣ Create a subclass called `Bird`

- This subclass should inherit all attributes and methods from `Animal`.
- Add a new method named `fly()`, which prints a message describing how high the bird can fly. This message should include the animal's name and mention the approximate flying height (e.g., "Eagle can fly up to 3,000 meters high.").

### 2️⃣ Create another subclass called `Reptile`

- This subclass should also inherit from `Animal`.
- Add a new method named `crawl()`, which prints a message describing how the reptile moves on the ground (for example, "Python moves by slithering smoothly across the ground.").
- Add another method named `length()`, which prints a message stating the length of the reptile (for example, "Python is about 6 meters long.").

## Instructions

- Use `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class if needed.
- Make sure each method includes a descriptive and meaningful message.
- Create at least one object from each subclass and try calling all the methods to check that everything works as expected.

### Extra Challenge

Try to think of even more specific methods that fit birds or reptiles and add them if you like!
