# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental approach that allows you to structure your programs around **objects**, which represent real-world entities. These objects combine **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods).

OOP makes your code more **modular**, **reusable**, and **easier to maintain**. By learning OOP, you will be able to design systems that are closer to how we think about the real world, using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
