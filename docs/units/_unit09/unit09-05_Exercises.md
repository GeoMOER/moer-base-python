## Task

Create a class named `Animal`.

### Attributes
- `name`: stores the name of the animal.
- `age`: stores the age of the animal.

### Methods
- `region()`: this method should print a message describing the region or area of the world where this animal is most common (e.g., "This animal lives mostly in Africa.").
- `sleep()`: this method should print a message indicating whether the animal sleeps during the day or at night (e.g., "This animal sleeps at night.").

## Instructions

- Define the constructor to initialize `name` and `age`.
- Use `self` to access and assign the attributes.
- Implement both methods as described above.
- Create an object of your `Animal` class and test both methods.

### Hint

Be creative when describing the region and sleep behavior to make your class more interesting.
