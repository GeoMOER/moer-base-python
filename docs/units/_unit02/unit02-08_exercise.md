# Introduction

Welcome to this Python exercise! In this exercise, you will work with basic Python operations such as performing arithmetic, and working with variables.

## Task 1: Add, Subtract, and Multiply Two Numbers

### Description:
Write a program that defines two numbers and calculates their sum, difference, and product.

### Steps:

1. Define two variables: `number1` and `number2`.
2. Assign any integer value to the variables
3. Add, subtract, and multiply these two numbers.
4. Print the results of the calculations.

## Task 2: Variables and Types

### Description:
In this task, you will define different types of variables, display their values, sum them, and identify their types.

### Instructions:

1. Define three variables: `zahl1`, `zahl2`, and `text`.
2. Assign any integer value to `zahl1`, any floating-point value to `zahl2`, and any string to `text`.
3. Display the values of `zahl1`, `zahl2`, and `text`.
4. Calculate the sum of `zahl1` and `zahl2` and display the result.
5. Print the data type of `zahl1`, `zahl2`, and `text`.

## Task 3: String Manipulation

### Description:
In this task, you will perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, length calculation, replacement, finding characters, splitting, counting characters, changing cases, and extracting substrings.

### Instructions:

1. Define two strings: `string1` and `string2`.
2. Concatenate the two strings and print the result.
3. Calculate the length of the concatenated string and print the result.
4. Replace all occurrences of a specific character in `string1` with another character and print the result.
5. Find the position of a specific character in `string2` and print the result.
6. Split `string2` into multiple lines and print the result.
7. Count how many times a specific character appears in `string1` and print the result.
8. Convert `string1` to uppercase and lowercase, and print both results.
9. Extract a substring from `string1` and print the result.

## Task 4: Replace Characters in a String Using Input

### Description:
Write a program that asks the user for a sentence and two characters. Replace all occurrences of the first character with the second character in the sentence and print the result.

### Instructions:

1. Use the `input` function to ask the user for a sentence.
2. Use the `input` function to ask the user for two characters: one to be replaced and one to replace it.
3. Use the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of the first character in the sentence with the second character.
4. Print the new sentence.
