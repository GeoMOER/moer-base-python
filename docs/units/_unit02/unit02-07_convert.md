In Python, data types are automatically assigned to variables. You can check the type of any value using the `type()` function. If needed, you can also convert a value to a different data type using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`.

Python has three numeric types. The most common are `float` (for numbers with decimals) and `int` (for whole numbers). Python will often switch between these automatically, so whether a number like `3` is stored as an `int` or a `float` often doesnâ€™t matter in practice.

However, sometimes you may want to store a number as an integerâ€”especially if itâ€™s used for counting, indexing, or IDsâ€”because integers use less memory. If you're going to do math with decimals, it's better to use floats.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Python automatically treats Boolean values in arithmetic contexts as integers: `True` behaves like `1` and `False` like `0`.  
> For example, `print(True + True)` will output `2`, and `print(False * 100)` will output `0`.

The table below gives an overview of the most common data types in Python.

| Data Type  | check type          | convert      |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|
| integer    | `type(x) == int`    | `int(x)`     |
| float      | `type(x) == float`  | `float(x)`   |
| string     | `type(x) == str`    | `str(x)`     |

<i>Example</i>

```python
value = 23.5

print(type(value))
# Output: <class 'float'>

print(int(value))
print(str(value))

boolean_var = True
print(int(boolean_var))  # Output: 1
print(True + True)       # Output: 2
print(False * 100)       # Output: 0
```
