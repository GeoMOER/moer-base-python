## What are Booleans?
Booleans are a data type that can hold one of two values: True or False. They are used to represent truth values and are essential for making decisions in your programs.
```python
is_true = True
is_false = False
```

## Boolean Expressions
Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either True or False. They are commonly used in conditional statements and loops. There are two kind of operators. Relational and Logical Operators.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

# Greater than
print(a > b)
# Output: True

# Less than
print(a < b)
# Output: False

# Equal to
print(a == b)
# Output: False

# Not equal to
print(a != b)
# Output: True

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)
# Output: True

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)
# Output: False
```

```python
x = True
y = False
