Understanding basic data types is a fundamental step in learning any programming language. In Python, different types of data, such as numbers, text, and logical values, form the foundation of all programs. Variables allow you to store and work with this data efficiently, but understanding the data types themselves is key to writing effective code.

This unit focuses on the most important basic data types — integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings — and shows how to use and convert between these types when necessary. The concept of variables will also be briefly introduced to explain how data is stored and managed.

## This session
In this unit, you will learn:
- a short introduction to store and manage data;
- how to work with numbers, text, and boolean values;
- how and why to convert data from one type to another;


By the end of this unit, you will have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks that are essential for any Python program.

* distinguish between numeric, boolean, and string data types;
* perform basic operations on numbers and strings;
* apply boolean logic in simple expressions;
* convert between different data types as needed;
* declare and use simple variables to store data.
