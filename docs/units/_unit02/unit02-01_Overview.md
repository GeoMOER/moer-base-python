Understanding variables and data types is a fundamental step in learning any programming language. In Python, variables allow you to store, manage, and manipulate data easily. Different types of data, such as numbers, text, and logical values, play a crucial role in building efficient and meaningful programs.

This unit introduces the concept of variables, explores various fundamental data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings, and shows how to convert between these types when necessary.

## This session
In this unit, you will learn:
- how to create and assign variables;
- how to work with numbers and text;
- the importance and use of boolean values in logical operations;
- how and why to convert data from one type to another.

By the end of this unit, you will have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks that are essential for any Python program.
