In Python, all data is categorized into basic types such as numbers, text, and logical values. 

Understanding these basic data types
- integers, 
- floats, 
- strings, and 
- booleans 

is In Python, all pieces of information belong to a specific basic data type. These types include numbers (integers and floats), text (strings), and logical values (booleans). Knowing how to work with these types is essential for writing programs that can calculate, process text, or make decisions.

Variables make it easier to manage data by giving it a name. Instead of working directly with values all the time, you can store them in variables and refer to them whenever needed.  
This not only makes programs easier to read and understand but also allows you to reuse and modify data efficiently.

In this unit, we will explore the basic data types in Python and see how variables help us organize and work with them.
