## Why Variables
In Python, you can perform basic calculations by directly writing numbers and operations. Python will give you the results as output. For example:

```python
3 + 5
# Output: 8

312 - 43
# Output: 269

7 * 2
# Output: 14

9 / 3
# Output: 3
```

You could write the numbers and operations every time and manually note down the results, but this can become cumbersome. Instead, you can save these values into variables to reuse them and make your code cleaner and more efficient.

```python
sum = 3 + 5
sub = 312 - 43
mul = 7 * 2
```

## Variables as Memory References
A **variable stores values in memory**.

A variable is a **named storage location** that holds data used during program execution. Variables allow you to store information that may change while the program runs.

### Different Data Types
A variable can store different types of data:

```python
city = "Marburg"  # String (Text)
temperature = 18.5  # Float (Decimal number)
cloud_coverage = 75  # Integer (Whole number)
is_sunny = False  # Boolean (True/False)
```

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/unit_images/u03/container.webp" %}

You can think of variables as **references to stored information** rather than fixed containers. When you assign a value to a variable, Python stores the value in memory, and the variable acts as a reference to that location.

### Variable Reassignment
A variable can only refer to one value at a time. When a new value is assigned to the same variable, the previous reference is lost.

```python
a = 5
print(a)  # Output: 5

a = 7
print(a)  # Output: 7
```

### Naming Conventions

> ‚ÄúAll things are defined by names. Change the name, and you change the thing.‚Äù ‚Äî Terry Pratchett, *Pyramids*

#### Rules for Variable Names:
- Variables can contain **letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)**, but cannot start with a number.
- No spaces or special characters are allowed (e.g., `-` is invalid).
- Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).
- Reserved words like `type` or `print` should not be used as variable names.

#### Recommended Naming Style
- Use **underscores** for multiple words:

```python
flower_name = "Daisy"
print(flower_name)
```

- Avoid starting with numbers:

```python
3Beta = 4  # Invalid!
```

- Use **descriptive names** instead of generic ones:

```python
x1, xx  # Not recommended
num_students, avg_temperature  # Better!
```

## Dynamic Typing
Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime. You do not need to declare the type explicitly.

```python
a = 1  # Integer
b = "Peter"  # String
c = [1, 2, 3]  # List
print(a + b + c)  # Causes an error!
```

### Type Error
Python does not allow operations between incompatible types:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

## User Input with `input()`

In real-world programs, values are often provided by the user. In Python, this is done using the `input()` function.

The `input()` function:
- Prompts the user to enter data from the keyboard
- Always returns the result as a **string**, even if the user types a number

### Basic Example:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

### Working with Numbers:
To work with numbers, you must convert the input:
```python
age = input("How old are you? ")       # Returns a string
age = int(age)                         # Convert to integer
print("In 5 years, you will be", age + 5)
```

üëâ Always remember to convert user input to the correct type before performing calculations.

### Important:
- When using `input()` in **Visual Studio Code**, make sure to run your script in the **Terminal** (e.g., by right-clicking the editor and selecting *"Run Python File in Terminal"*).
- If you run the script in a non-interactive console or debugger, `input()` might cause an error like `EOFError`.


### How to run `input()` properly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

If you're using **Visual Studio Code**, here's how to use `input()` without any issues:

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Save your file** with a `.py` extension, e.g., `hello.py`

2. **Write your code**, for example:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
input("Press Enter to exit...")
```

3. **Open the Terminal in VS Code**
   - Menu: `Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal`
   - or shortcut: `Ctrl + √∂` (German layout) or `Ctrl + ~` (US layout)

4. **Run your script using the terminal**:
   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```
   or (if `python` doesn't work):
   ```bash
   py hello.py
   ```

5. **Alternatively**, right-click inside the file and select:
   - `Run Python File in Terminal`

Now, your input prompt will appear in the terminal at the bottom, and you can type freely.

|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `input()` does not wait for input | Script was run in Python Interactive Window | Use "Run in Terminal" instead               |
| Terminal closes immediately        | No pause at end of script                   | Add `input("Press Enter to exit...")`       |
| `'python' is not recognized`       | Python is not installed or not in PATH      | Use `py` or install Python properly         |
