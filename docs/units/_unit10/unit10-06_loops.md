# Loops

Loops let you execute code repeatedly. In Python, the main loop types are:

- **for loops**: Iterate over a sequence (like a list or string)
- **while loops**: Repeat as long as a condition is True

Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing data efficiently.

## Examples

```python
# for loop example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# while loop example
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1
```

Loops make your code more powerful and allow you to work with collections of data easily.
