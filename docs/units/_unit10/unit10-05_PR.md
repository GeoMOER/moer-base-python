Artificial Intelligence has a growing impact on society.  
It offers significant benefits, but also raises important social and ethical concerns.

Understanding both sides is essential for responsible use.

## Benefits of Artificial Intelligence

AI can support society in many positive ways:

- **Efficiency and productivity**  
  Automates repetitive tasks and reduces workload

- **Support in healthcare**  
  Assists medical diagnosis and data analysis

- **Accessibility and inclusion**  
  Supports people with disabilities (e.g. speech recognition, text-to-speech)

- **Scientific and environmental research**  
  Helps analyze complex data and detect patterns

AI can act as a **supportive tool** that enhances human capabilities.

## Risks and Social Challenges

At the same time, AI poses several risks:

- **Loss of critical thinking**  
  Overreliance on automated answers

- **Reduced creativity**  
  Fewer original ideas when AI replaces human creation

- **Bias and discrimination**  
  Unfair decisions caused by biased data

- **Job displacement**  
  Automation of routine tasks

- **Privacy concerns**  
  Collection and use of personal data

These risks increase when AI systems are used without reflection or control.

## Key message

> **Artificial Intelligence should support humans, not replace them.**

The social impact of AI depends not on the technology itself,  
but on **how humans choose to design, use, and regulate it**.

Responsible use requires:
- critical thinking
- ethical awareness
- human oversight
