Welcome to the final unit of this course!

In this unit, you will find a complete overview of all exercises from Units. Use this summary to check which parts you have already completed and which ones might still be open. This is your chance to **review**, **reflect**, and **finalize** your work.

The **final thesis submission**  will be graded â€” please make sure to follow the instructions carefully and submit your work before the deadline. For details see the [Deliverables](/moer-base-python/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) section.
