Welcome to the **Base Python course review section**!  

This section is designed to help you **refresh your skills**, strengthen your confidence, and prepare you for applying Python in more advanced projects or real-world tasks.  

Instead of simply repeating concepts, you are encouraged to actively **practice**, explore additional examples, and reflect on how each topic connects to problem-solving in programming.  

Take this time to revisit what you have learned, ask questions, and deepen your understanding â€” so you can continue your Python journey with a solid and confident foundation.
