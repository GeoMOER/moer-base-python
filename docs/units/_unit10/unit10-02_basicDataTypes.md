# Basic Data Types

In Python, data types are the fundamental building blocks that define the nature of a value. The most common basic data types include:

- **Integers (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., `5`, `-2`)
 ```python
  my_age = 30
 ```  
- **Floating-point numbers (`float`)**: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`), useful for precise measurements.
 ```python
 pi = 3.1415
 ``` 
- **Boolean (`bool`)**: True or False values, often used in condition checks.
 ```python
 is_active = True
 ``` 
- **Strings (`str`)**: Sequences of characters, used to store text.
 ```python
 name = "Alice"
 ``` 

Understanding these types is essential for correct variable usage and arithmetic or logical operations in your programs.
