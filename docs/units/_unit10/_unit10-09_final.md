## üéØ Simple Tasks for Warm-up

### Task 1: Even and Odd Numbers *(6 points)*

Write a program that loops through the numbers from 1 to 20 and prints whether each number is even or odd.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a loop from 1 to 20. *(2 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use an if-else statement to check even or odd. *(2 points)*

---

### Task 2: Sum of Even Numbers *(6 points)*

Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 1000.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a loop from 1 to 1000. *(2 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a condition to select only even numbers. *(2 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate and print the final sum. *(2 points)*

---

### Task 3: D3TD5T *(6 points)*

Write a program that loops through the list of numbers. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a list of numbers (e.g., 1 to 50). *(2 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check divisibility by 3, 5, and both. *(2 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Print the correct label or number. *(2 points)*

---

### Task 4: Finding a Friend *(6 points)*

Write a program that loops through a list of friends  and looks for a specific friend.
- If the friend is found, print a message.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Define a list of friends. *(1 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Loop through the list to search for a given name. *(3 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Print a message if found (or if not found). *(2 points)*

---

### Task 5: Replace Characters *(6 points)*

Write a program that goes through a list of fruits and replaces all occurrences of a specific character (e.g., "a") in each word with another character (e.g., "o").


1Ô∏è‚É£ Define a list of fruits. *(1 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Loop through each fruit and replace a character. *4 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Print each modified fruit name. *(1 s)*

---

### Task 6: Remove and Add Friends with Loop and Replace *(6 points)*

Write a program that:
- Loops through a list of friends.
- Removes "Ben" if present.
- Adds a new friend "Felix" at position 2.
- Replaces "Anna" directly with "Bella".


1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove "Ben" from the list if present. *(2 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add "Felix" at position 2. *(2 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Replace "Anna" with "Bella". *(2 points)*

---

### üîç Task 7: Loop through each name in the list *(15 points)*

**Description:**

In this task, you will practice iterating over a list and stopping a search as soon as a condition is met.

---

**Preparation:**

- Create a string variable my_name containing your own first name.
- Create a boolean variable found, initialized as False.

---

**Steps:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Loop through the list using an iterator.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if name matches my_name.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ If a match is found:
- Set found = True.
- Immediately **break** the loop.

4Ô∏è‚É£ After the loop, check found:
- If still False, print:  
No registration found for user {searched_name}. You are not yet registered for the course "Python Base Course".
- Replace {searched_name} with your actual my_name variable.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Define my_name and found variables. *1 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Loop through the list using an iterator, check for a match; if found, set found = True and immediately **break** the loop. *8 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ After the loop, check found:
- If False, print:  
  No registration found for user {searched_name}. You are not yet registered for the course "Python Base Course".
- Replace {searched_name} with your my_name. *(5 points)*


---

### Task 8: üé≤ Game ‚Äî "Lucky String Duel: You vs Computer" *(15 points)*

**Description:**

In this advanced mini-game, you will play a "lucky string draw" duel against the computer!  
Imagine you both have access to a magical bag containing 100 surprise words.



**Preparation:**

- Create these six variables:
  - myResultB (int, initialized to 0): Counts words starting with "S".
  - myResultBo (int, initialized to 0): Counts words starting with "St".
  - myStrike (int, initialized to 0): Bonus if "Strike" is drawn.
  - comResultB, comResultBo, comStrike: Same for the computer.


**Steps:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Roll a virtual dice (0 to 99) five times each (you and computer).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ For each roll, pick the word at that index from the list.

---

**Rules:**

- Starts with "S" ‚Üí +1 point.
- Starts with "St" ‚Üí +10 points.
- Exactly "Strike" ‚Üí +100 points.

---

**After all rolls:**

- Calculate total points for both.
- Print a winner message based on scores.
- Print a detailed summary with all variable values.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create counters for points and prepare a list of 100 words. *(3 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate five virtual dice rolls for each player and select words based on index. *(6 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate scores, determine the winner, and print a detailed summary with all variables. *(6 points)*

---

### Task 9: üó∫Ô∏è "Visualizing the Largest Cities in Europe Based on Coordinates" *(15 points)*

**Description:**

You will work with the worldcities.csv file (SimpleMaps).

---

**Instructions:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the World Cities dataset as a ZIP from SimpleMaps.  
üëâ Use the **free version**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unzip and **note the path** to worldcities.csv.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Load it into a pandas DataFrame and **print column names**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Filter cities in Europe using:
- Latitude: 35¬∞ to 72¬∞ N.
- Longitude: -25¬∞ to 45¬∞ E.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Print city names** from the filtered DataFrame.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sort by population (descending).

7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **bar chart** (Matplotlib) for the top 10 largest cities.
- X-axis: City names.
- Y-axis: Population.
- Add title, e.g., *"Top 10 Largest Cities in Europe (by Population)"*.

1Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 points)*  
2Ô∏è‚É£ *(1 points)*  
3Ô∏è‚É£ *(2 points)*
4.  *(4 points)*
