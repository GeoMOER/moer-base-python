## 💻 Working with Jupyter at Marburg University

At Philipps-Universität Marburg, Jupyter notebooks are widely used in courses and practical labs.  
They allow you to combine code, text, images, and visualizations all in one document — ideal for experimenting and sharing results.

If you are a student at Marburg, you can access Jupyter via:

- The **JupyterHub service** provided by the university (e.g., through central computer pools or course-specific servers).
- Local installation on your own laptop, using Anaconda or `pip install notebook`.

**Tip:** Jupyter is perfect for step-by-step explanations and trying out code snippets from this course.
