# Introduction

This unit covers Python loops, focusing on `for` loops. You will practice using loops to solve various tasks that involve iterating through ranges and lists.

## Task 1: Even and Odd Numbers

### Description:
Practice using a loop to determine if numbers are even or odd.

### Instructions:
1. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 20.
2. For each number, check if it is even or odd.
3. Print the result for each number, indicating whether it is "even" or "odd".

---

## Task 2: Sum of Even Numbers

### Description:
Use a loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers within a range.

### Instructions:
1. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is even.
3. Accumulate the sum of all even numbers and print the result at the end.

## Task 3: D3TD5T

### Description:
Combine loops and conditionals to categorize numbers.

### Instructions:
1. Write a `for` loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 30.
2. For numbers divisible by 3, print "D3T".
3. For numbers divisible by 5, print "D5T".
4. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "D3TD5T".
5. For all other numbers, just print the number.

## Task 4: Find a Friend

### Description:
Use a loop to search for an item in a list.

### Instructions:
1. Define a list of friends' names, such as `["Anna", "Ben", "Clara", "David", "Eva"]`.
2. Use a `for` loop to search for a specific friend (e.g., "Clara").
3. If the friend is found, print a message that they were found.

## Task 5: Replace a Character in a List of Fruits

### Description:
Use a loop to replace characters in strings.

### Instructions:
1. Define a list of fruit names, such as `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
2. Use a `for` loop to go through each fruit.
3. Replace occurrences of a specific character (e.g., replace "a" with "o") in each word.
4. Print the modified list.

---

## Task 6: Modify a List of Friends

### Description:
Practice modifying elements of a list using loops.

### Instructions:
1. Define a list of friends `["Anna", "Ben", "Clara", "David", "Eva"]`.
2. Use a `for` loop to remove "Ben" and replace "Anna" with "Bella".
3. Add a new friend, "Felix", at position 1 in the list.
4. Print the modified list.
