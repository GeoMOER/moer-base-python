Loops let you repeat code without writing it multiple times. They help automate tasks, work with lists, and run code until a condition is met. Python has two main loop types: **for** and **while**.

- Use a **for-loop** when you know how many times to repeat.
- Use a **while-loop** when the number of repetitions depends on a condition.

### For-loop
```python
for item in sequence:
    # do something
```

### While-loop
```python
while condition:
    # do something and update the condition
```

## Choosing the Right Loop
- `for` = fixed number of steps
- `while` = unknown number of steps

### Examples
- Iterate over a list → `for`
- Repeat a task until a condition is met → `while`

## Indentation
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Always indent consistently (e.g., 4 spaces).
