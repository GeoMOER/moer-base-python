# Python Basics – Practice Tasks

This worksheet introduces Python and helps you get started with the first steps of programming. Follow the tasks carefully and write your answers in your own words or in Python code.

---

## 1️⃣ Why Python?

**Question**: What are the main reasons why Python is so popular?  
**Task**: List at least 3 advantages Python offers compared to other programming languages (e.g. Java, C++, etc.).

---

## 2️⃣ What is an Interpreter?

**Question**: What do you understand by the term *interpreter* in programming?  
**Task**: Explain in your own words how an interpreter works and how it differs from a compiler.

---

## 3️⃣ Write an Algorithm: Baking Bread

**Task**: Describe the process of baking bread using a simple algorithm. Include **two conditional checks**:
- Check the dough consistency: If not good → mix more.
- Check if the bread is ready: If not → adjust the oven.

You can write it in natural language, but try to structure it clearly (like pseudocode or flow logic).

---

## 4️⃣ Install Python and Visual Studio Code

**Task**: Install the latest version of Python and Visual Studio Code on your computer.  
Optional: Take a screenshot of your installed Python version in the terminal.

---

## 5️⃣ Check Your Python Version and Path

**Task**:
1. Open the terminal (or CMD).
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python --version
   where python   # or: which python (macOS/Linux)
   ```
3. Write down the version and the path.

---

## 6️⃣ What is the Python Path?

**Question**: What does the Python Path mean?  
**Task**: Describe what it contains and why it's important.

---

## 7️⃣ Can You Have Multiple Python Versions?

**Question**: Is it possible to use more than one Python version on the same computer?  
**Task**: Explain how that works and when it might be useful.

---

## 8️⃣ Your First Python Script

**Task**:
1. Create a folder called `unit01_EX`.
2. Inside it, create a Python file called `print_user_CR.py`.
3. In the file, use `print()` to show your:
   - Last name
   - First name
   - Address

3. Open the terminal and run the script:

   ```

---

## ⭐ Bonus Task – Input Practice

**Task**:
1. Create a new file in the same folder: `input_user_CR.py`.
2. Use `input()` to collect:
   - Your last name
   - Your first name
   - Your address
3. Output the result using `print()`.

Run the script in the terminal and test it.
