Make sure your code is clearly structured and includes comments where helpful.

This worksheet introduces Python and helps you get started with the first steps of programming. Follow the tasks carefully and write your answers in your own words or in Python code.

---

### 1️⃣ What are the main reasons why Python is so popular?  

---

### 2️⃣ What do you understand by the term *interpreter* in programming?  

---

### 3️⃣ Describe the process of doing laundry using a simple algorithm. Include two conditional checks:

Check the water temperature: If not correct → adjust it.

Check if the clothes are clean: If not → run another wash cycle.

You can write it in natural language, but try to structure it clearly (like pseudocode or flow logic).

---

### 4️⃣ Install the latest version of Python on your computer.

### 5️⃣ Check Your Python Version and Path

**Task**:
1. Open the terminal (or CMD).
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python --version
   where python   # or: which python (macOS/Linux)
   ```
3. Write down the version and the path.

---

### 6️⃣ What does the Python Path mean? Describe what it contains and why it's important.

---

### 7️⃣ Is it possible to use more than one Python version on the same computer?  

---

### 8️⃣ Your First Python Script

Use function `print()` to print:
   - Last name
   - First name
   - Address
   
---

### ⭐ Bonus Task – Input Practice

Use function `input()` to collect:
   - Your last name
   - Your first name
