Approaching the topic of programming with Python can be both exciting and challenging, especially for those with little or no prior experience. Programming is not only about writing code, but also about learning to think analytically, solve problems efficiently, and translate ideas into structured instructions. Python, as a versatile and beginner-friendly language, offers a gentle learning curve while being powerful enough for complex applications in data science, automation, and research. This unit lays the foundation by introducing the Python environment, guiding the installation process, and encouraging participants to take their very first steps in writing and understanding Python code.


## This session
This unit provides an entry point into Python programming by guiding you through the essential steps needed to get started. It begins with a brief introduction to the relevance and versatility of Python in scientific and applied contexts. The next section familiarizes you with the user interface of a typical Python development environment, helping you understand how to interact with the system efficiently. You will then proceed to install Python and essential libraries, laying the foundation for future work. Finally, you will take your very first steps in writing and executing Python code, establishing confidence in using the language for simple operations.
