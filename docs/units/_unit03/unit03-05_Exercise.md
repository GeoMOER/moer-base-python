# Introduction

This unit covers Python's basic operators, focusing on arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. You will practice using these operators through multiple tasks to solidify your understanding.

## Task 1: Arithmetic and Comparison Operators

### Description:
Practice using arithmetic and comparison operators in Python.

### Instructions:
1. Define two variables: `a = 10` and `b = 5`.
2. Perform the following arithmetic operations and print the results:
   - Modulus: Calculate the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.
   - Exponentiation: Raise `a` to the power of `b`.
3. Perform the following comparison operations and print whether each statement is true or false:
   - Check if `a` is equal to `b`.
   - Check if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - Check if `a` is greater than `b`.
   - Check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

## Task 2: Logical and Combined Operations

### Description:
Use comparison operators in combination with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) in Python.

### Instructions:
1. Define the same two variables: `a = 10` and `b = 5`.
2. Perform the following combined operations:
   - Check if `a` is greater than 8 **and** `b` is less than 10.
   - Check if `a` is equal to 10 **or** `b` is equal to 10.
   - Use the `not` operator to invert a comparison result.
3. Print the result of each logical operation.
