# Introduction

This unit covers Python's basic operators and data structures, including vectors (lists), data frames (using pandas), matrices, arrays, lists, and factors. You will work through various tasks to build familiarity with these concepts.

## Task 1: Operators

### Description:
Explore the usage of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators in Python.

### Instructions:
1. Define two variables `a = 10` and `b = 5`.
2. Perform the following operations:
    - Modulus, exponentiation
    - Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
    - Combine the comparison operators with logical operations using `and`, `or`, `not`
3. Print the results of each operation.
