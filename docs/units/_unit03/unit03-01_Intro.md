*Strings are everywhere—from user names and messages to data labels and file names. In this unit, you'll learn how to work with text effectively, and how to use simple operators to bring logic and structure to your Python programs.*

In programming, it’s not enough to store data—you also need to work with it, compare it, and make decisions. This unit introduces some of the most important tools for that: strings, operators, and logic.

We start with **strings**, which represent text in Python. You’ll learn how to manipulate strings using built-in functions and methods—for example, changing the case of text, replacing parts of it, or checking whether certain words are present.

Next, we explore **mathematical operators** to perform basic arithmetic. These allow your programs to calculate values, such as totals, percentages, or averages.

With **comparison operators**, you’ll learn how to ask questions like "Is this number greater than that one?" or "Are these two strings the same?". These are essential for making decisions.

Finally, we’ll introduce **logical operators**. They help you combine multiple conditions—like saying "this AND that must be true" or "either this OR that".

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to write Python code that thinks: analyzing data, checking conditions, and responding accordingly.
