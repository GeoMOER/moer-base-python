*Strings are everywhere—from user names and messages to data labels and file names. In this unit, you'll learn how to work with text effectively, and how to use simple operators to bring logic and structure to your Python programs.*

<!--more-->

By the end of this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Understand what strings are and how to manipulate them using built-in methods,
- Format and combine text in powerful and flexible ways,
- Use Python’s simple operators to:
  - Perform mathematical calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`),
  - Compare values (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`),
  - Apply logic with conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`),
- Write small, expressive programs that combine strings and logic.

Mastering strings and basic operators is a key step in writing clear, meaningful Python code—whether you're building user interfaces, analyzing data, or just making your programs speak your language.
