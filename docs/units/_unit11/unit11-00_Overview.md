Unit 11 introduces the topic of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and shows how the Python skills you have learned form the **foundation of modern AI systems**.

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept — it is already part of everyday life, from recommendation systems and image recognition to language models and automated decision-making.  
Understanding AI does not start with complex mathematics, but with **data, logic, and structured thinking** — exactly what you practiced throughout this course.

In the previous units, you learned essential Python concepts that are also used in AI and data-driven applications:

- **Variables and data types**: Storing and processing information
- **Control structures**: Making decisions in code
- **Loops**: Repeating operations efficiently
- **Data structures**: Lists, dictionaries, arrays, and DataFrames
- **Working with data**: Reading, cleaning, and analyzing CSV files
- **Basic visualisations**: Exploring patterns and trends in data

In **Unit 11**, you will learn:

- What **Artificial Intelligence** is — and what it is not
- How AI differs from **classical programming**
- The role of **data** in AI systems
- Why Python is one of the most important languages for AI and machine learning
- How simple rule-based logic relates to intelligent behavior

This unit does **not** aim to train AI models.  
Instead, it provides a **conceptual understanding** of AI and helps you connect your Python knowledge to real-world AI applications.

The goal of this overview is to help you see **Python as a gateway technology** — a tool that enables you to understand, evaluate, and critically reflect on Artificial Intelligence systems you encounter in science, industry, and everyday life.
