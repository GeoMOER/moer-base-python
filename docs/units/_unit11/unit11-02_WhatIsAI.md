**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to computer systems that are designed to perform tasks which normally require **human intelligence**.

Such tasks include:
- recognizing patterns
- analyzing data
- making decisions
- understanding language
- supporting problem-solving

AI systems do **not think** or **understand** in a human sense.  
They operate based on **algorithms, rules, and data**.

## A simple way to understand AI

A helpful way to think about AI is this:

> **AI systems simulate intelligent behavior,  
> but they do not possess intelligence themselves.**

They do not have:
- consciousness  
- emotions  
- intentions  
- awareness  

Instead, they process input and produce output based on learned or predefined patterns.

---

## AI is not the same as human intelligence

Human intelligence includes:
- experience
- intuition
- creativity
- ethical judgment

Artificial Intelligence, in contrast:
- follows mathematical models
- works with probabilities
- depends entirely on data and instructions

Even advanced AI systems do not “know” what they are doing —  
they only calculate what is **most likely** according to their training.

## AI and classical programming: a first intuition

In **classical programming**, a developer defines explicit rules:

> *If this happens, do that.*

In **AI systems**, the rules are often not written directly.  
Instead, the system learns patterns from data.

However, both approaches are based on:
- logic
- structured processes
- human design decisions

AI does not replace programming — it builds on it.

---

## Why AI can appear intelligent

AI systems can seem intelligent because they can:
- process large amounts of data quickly
- detect patterns humans might miss
- generate convincing outputs (text, images, predictions)

This can create the **illusion of understanding**.

But it is important to remember:
> AI produces **plausible results**, not necessarily **true or correct ones**.

---

## AI as a tool, not an authority

Artificial Intelligence should be understood as a **tool** that supports humans.

It can:
- assist decision-making
- reduce repetitive work
- offer suggestions

But it cannot:
- take responsibility
- evaluate ethical consequences
- replace human judgment

The final responsibility for decisions and interpretations always lies with humans.

---

## Key takeaway

- Artificial Intelligence simulates intelligent behavior
- AI systems do not think or understand
- They depend entirely on data, algorithms, and human design
- AI should support human intelligence — not replace it

Understanding what AI **is** (and what it is **not**) is the first step toward using it responsibly and critically.
