In this unit, you'll explore how to control the flow of a Python program using conditional logic and error handling.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics

- **`if` statements**  
  Execute code only when a condition is true.

- **`if-else` statements**  
  Provide alternative actions when the condition is false.

- **`if-elif` and `if-elif-else` chains**  
  Handle multiple conditions in sequence.

- **Multiple `elif` branches**  
  Test many conditions clearly and efficiently.

- **`try-except` blocks**  
  Handle runtime errors gracefully.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goal

You will be able to write programs that make decisions based on different conditions and avoid crashes by managing potential errors during execution.
