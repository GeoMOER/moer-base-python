# Introduction

This unit focuses on Python's control flow structures, particularly using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. You'll create small programs to practice decision-making and flow control based on given variables.

## Task 1: Age Verification

### Description:
Write a program that checks if a given age qualifies as being an adult.

### Code Example:
```python
age = 20  # change this value to test
if age 
```

---

## Task 2: Even or Odd Number

### Description:
Write a program that determines if a given number is even or odd.

### Code Example:
```python
number = 7  # change this value to test
if number % 2 ...:
    
else:
    
```

## Task 3: Grade Evaluation

### Description:
Create a program that evaluates a student's grade and assigns a classification based on a scoring scale.

### Code Example:
```python
grade = 83  # change this value to test

if grade >= 90:
    print("Excellent")
elif grade >=:
    print("Good")
elif grade ...:
.
.
.
else:
    
```
