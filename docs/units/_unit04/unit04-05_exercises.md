# Introduction

This unit focuses on Python's control flow structures, particularly using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. You'll create small programs to practice decision-making and flow control based on user input.

## Task 1: Age Verification

### Description:
Write a program that checks if the user's age qualifies as being an adult.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to enter their age.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the age is 18 or older.
3. If true, print "You are an adult."

## Task 2: Even or Odd Number

### Description:
Write a program that determines if a given number is even or odd.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to enter a number.
2. Use `if` and `else` to check if the number is divisible by 2.
3. Print "The number is even" for even, and "The number is odd" for odd.

## Task 3: Grade Evaluation

### Description:
Create a program that evaluates a student's grade and assigns a classification based on a scoring scale.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to enter a grade between 0 and 100.
2. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to categorize the grade as follows:
   - 90 and above: "Excellent"
   - 80 to 89: "Good"
   - 70 to 79: "Satisfactory"
   - 60 to 69: "Pass"
   - 50 to 59: "Poor"
   - Below 50: "Fail"

## Task 4: Temperature Classification

### Description:
Write a program that classifies the temperature in Celsius.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius.
2. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to classify the temperature as:
   - 30°C or higher: "Hot"
   - 20°C to 29°C: "Warm"
   - 10°C to 19°C: "Cool"
   - Below 10°C: "Cold"
