### What is the expected workload for this course?
This course gives 6 ECTS credit points, corresponding to a total workload of 180 hours.  
Subtracting the time spent during the 11 course sessions (11 × 1.5 hours) from the total, and dividing the remaining hours over 11 weeks results in an average additional workload of approximately 13.6 hours per week outside the classroom.  
((180 – (11 × 1.5)) ÷ 11 ≈ 13.6)

Please note that this workload is designed to achieve an average grade according to the official European study system.
