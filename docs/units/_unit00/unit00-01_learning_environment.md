*Find out how this course is supposed to work*

<!--more-->

This course is intended as a blended learning module, although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study only, too. 

## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub. Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help. The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.

Please also not that the HTML learning environment has a FAQ page for recurring questions and a comment functionality on the first page of each unit.


## Setting
This course will take place in a hybrid synchronous setting in presence in room F 14 | 00A19. In addition, there will be regular meetings with a tutor. Details on the additional tutor sessions will be provided in the first regular session, which will take place on Thursday 24.04.2025	 at 14:00 am (German time) in room F 14 | 00A19. The virtual room for online participants will be announced by email and must be accesses via ILIAS. Note that the tutor sessions are voluntary.

## Flexible learning with deadlines

During the asynchronous phase, you'll work at your own pace to master the basics of the material provided in the HTML learning environment(s). Then, our synchronous sessions will start by query what you've learned in the asynchronous phase and serve as collaborative hubs where we'll delve deeper into real-world applications and complex tasks. These interactive discussions require your attendance.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.
For details see the [Deliverables](/moer-base-python/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) section.

## Hybrid setting

The course will take place in a synchronous hybrid setting on a weekly basis. This means, that students can attend the course in the seminar room in presence (room 00A19) or online using the link provided in Ilias.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents. The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/login.php?target=crs_4113838&cmd=force_login&lang=de). Note that you have to log in with your student account. In Ilias, you can also find the links to the online meeting room for the weekly session and for the tutorium.


## Classroom

You will use Classroom for uploading your assignments and for getting familiar with git. The link for joining our Classroom can be found in Ilias.
