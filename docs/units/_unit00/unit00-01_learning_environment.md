## Learning Environment
This course uses the **Jupyter Marburg** environment as the main platform for coding and practicing Python.  
You will work interactively in your browser — no local installation is required.  
All exercises, examples, and assignments can be opened and executed directly in Jupyter.

The sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person at the Department of [Environmental Informatics in Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics), and the others virtually. The link to the virtual meeting room will be provided be the instructors in the first session and can also be found in Ilias (see below).

## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub. Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help. The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.

Please also not that the HTML learning environment has a FAQ page for recurring questions.

### Structure of the HTML Learning EnvironmentPermalink

The HTML learning environment is organized into four distinct modules, each designed to guide you through various aspects of the course.

1. **LM (Learning Material):**  
   This module provides the theoretical background, supplementary information, and all the essential details you need to understand the concepts covered in the course. It serves as the foundation for the practical exercises you’ll complete later.

2. **EX (Exercises):**  
   These are practical sessions where you apply the concepts discussed in the learning material. Through hands-on coding, you’ll create the elements we’ve covered in theory, reinforcing your understanding and skill.

3. **A (Assignments):**  
   These are out-of-class exercises that require you to apply the course material in a more comprehensive way. Assignments are meant to test your understanding and ability to transfer the skills learned in the course. You must upload your completed assignments to ILIAS (unless otherwise stated) by the beginning of the next session.

## Flexible learning with deadlines

During the asynchronous phase, you'll work at your own pace to master the basics of the material provided in the HTML learning environment(s). Then, our synchronous sessions will start by query what you've learned in the asynchronous phase and serve as collaborative hubs where we'll delve deeper into real-world applications and complex tasks. These interactive discussions require your attendance.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.

## Hybrid setting

The course will take place in a synchronous hybrid setting on a weekly basis. This means, that students can attend the course in the seminar room in presence (room 00A19) or online using the link provided in Ilias.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents. The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found here. Note that you have to log in with your student account. In Ilias, you can also find the links to the online meeting room for the weekly session and for the tutorium.
All assignments should also be submitted via Ilias. Please make sure to respect the [deadlines](/moer-base-python/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) and upload your solutions in the required format.
