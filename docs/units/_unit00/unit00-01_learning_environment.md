## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help. 
The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. 
Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.

Please also note that the HTML learning environment has a FAQ page for recurring questions and a comment functionality on the first page of each unit.


## Flexible learning with deadlines

During the asynchronous phase, you'll work at your own pace to master the basics of the material provided in the HTML learning environment(s). Then, our synchronous sessions will start by query what you've learned in the asynchronous phase and serve as collaborative hubs where we'll delve deeper into real-world applications and complex tasks. These interactive discussions require your attendance.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.
For details see the [Deliverables](/moer-base-python/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) section.-->

## Virtual meeting room

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as main virtual classroom for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions for those who cannot be here in person.
The link to our classroom can be found in Ilias.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. 
We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents and data sharing.
Note that you have to log in with your student account. There is also a forum in Ilias, which you can use for getting in touch with your fellow students.
You will use Ilias for uploading your assignments. Please always add your full name to your assignments, e.g. "Assignment01_Heidrich_Lea".
This makes it easier for the course instructors to match the uploaded assignments to the students. If it can't be matched, it won't be considered.
