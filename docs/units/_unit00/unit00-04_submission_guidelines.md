## Upload of Your Exercises on ILIAS

All your exercise solutions must be uploaded in the following ILIAS folder:  
**`Submission/SS_2025`**

Make sure your folder and file structure follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth correction and feedback.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on ILIAS with the following naming convention:
   ```
   Lastname_SS_2025
   ```

   🔸 *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson → `Johnson_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create **one ZIP file per unit**, named:
   ```
   unit01.zip
   unit02.zip
   ...
   unit10.zip
   ```

3. Each `unitXX.zip` should contain your files for that unit, structured as follows:
   ```
   unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
   unitXX_code.py
   ```

---

### 📄 File Naming Guidelines

- Use the following format for written answers (as PDF):
  ```
  unitXX_ex1.pdf
  unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
  ```

- Use the following format for Python code:
  ```
  unitXX_ex(1-5)code.py
  ```

  📝 *This file should contain all your Python solutions (e.g., from exercises 6–10) in one script, clearly separated and commented.*

---

## ✅ Tips for Clean Submission

- Use **clear and consistent formatting** in your text files (you may also submit as `.pdf` if preferred).
- Make sure your **Python files run without errors** before submitting.
- Add **comments** in your code to explain your solution steps.
- Submit **only the required files** – avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.pyc`, cache folders, etc.

---

## 💡 Why This Is Important

This structure helps us:
- Quickly navigate through your work,
- Review your solutions fairly and efficiently,
- Give you timely feedback.

And it helps **you** practice good documentation habits, which are essential in real-world projects!
