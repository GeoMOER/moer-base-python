## Upload of Your Exercises on ILIAS

Please upload your full submission as a **single folder** named:  
**`Lastname_SS_2025`**  
to the following ILIAS folder:  
**`Submission/SS_2025`**

This folder should contain **one ZIP file per unit**.

---

### 📁 Folder and ZIP File Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on your computer:
   ```
   Lastname_SS_2025
   ```

   🔸 *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson → `Johnson_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create **one ZIP file per unit**, named:
   ```
   unit01.zip
   unit02.zip
   ...
   unit10.zip
   ```

3. Each `unitXX.zip` should contain your files for that unit, structured as follows:
   ```
   unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
   unitXX_ex6.py
   unitXX_ex7.py
   ...
   ```

✅ Example:
```
Johnson_SS_2025/
│
├── unit01.zip
├── unit02.zip
├── ...
├── unit10.zip
```

Inside `unit01.zip`:
```
unit01_ex1.pdf
unit01_ex2.pdf
unit01_ex6.py
unit01_ex7.py
```

---

### File Naming Guidelines

- Use the following format for written answers (as PDF):
  ```
  unitXX_ex1.pdf
  unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
  ```

- Use the following format for Python scripts:
  ```
  unitXX_ex6.py
  unitXX_ex7.py
  ```

---

## Tips for Clean Submission

- Test all Python scripts to ensure they run without errors.
- Include helpful comments in your code.
- Keep your naming consistent and your structure tidy.
- Do **not** include unnecessary files like `.pyc`, `__pycache__`, etc.

---

## Why This Structure?

This approach:

- Helps us correct and give feedback efficiently,
- Keeps your submission portable and organized,
- Trains you in clear digital project documentation – a crucial skill in real-world data science.
