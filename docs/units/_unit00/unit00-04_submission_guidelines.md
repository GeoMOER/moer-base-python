## Welcome!

Dear students,

To help you stay organized and make your submission process as smooth as possible, please follow these detailed guidelines carefully. By submitting your work in a clear and structured way, you not only make it easier for us to provide feedback, but you also develop essential skills for future research and professional projects.

---

## Upload of Your Exercises on ILIAS

All your exercise solutions must be uploaded in the following ILIAS folder:  
**`Submission/SS_2025`**

Make sure your folder and file structure follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth correction and feedback.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on ILIAS with the following naming convention:

   🔸 *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson → `JohnsonA_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create **one ZIP file per unit**, named:
   ```
   unit01.zip
   unit02.zip
   ...
   unit10.zip
   ```

3. Each `unitXX.zip` should contain your files for that unit, structured as follows:
   ```
   unitXX__ex(1-X)code.py
   ```

---

### 📄 File Naming Guidelines

- Use the following format for written answers and Python code:
  ```
  unitXX__ex(1-X)code.py
  ```
🔖 *At the top, please include your **student ID number** **and your full name** as a comment.*  
❗ *If either the name or the student ID is missing, points will be deducted.*  

*Example:*
```python
# Name: Alex Johnson
# Matrikelnummer: 12345678

  ```

  📝 *The .py file should contain all your Python solutions (e.g., from exercises 1 to X) in one script, with the task texts included as comments. Bonus solutions should be saved in a separate file named unitXX__exXXcode.py.*
  💬 *Comments and the written answer for Exercises may be written in either German or English.*

---

## ✅ Tips for Clean Submission

- Make sure your **Python files run without errors** before submitting.
- Add **comments** in your code to explain your solution steps.
- Submit **only the required files** – avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.pyc`, cache folders, etc.

---

## 📝 Where to Find Your Feedback

The results of the assignment corrections will be saved as a PDF table in the ILIAS folder:  
**Hausaufgaben-Feedback**

Legend for the table:

- A green cell next to your student ID means that all required exercises from Unit 01 were successfully completed.
- A white “B” inside the green cell indicates that the bonus exercise was also completed successfully.

---

## 💡 Why This Is Important

This structure helps us:
- Quickly navigate through your work,
- Review your solutions fairly and efficiently,
- Give you timely feedback.

And it helps **you** practice good documentation habits, which are essential in real-world projects!

---

## 🎓 Final Project (Abschlussarbeit)

The final project (Abschlussarbeit) will be presented in the second-to-last session.  
After that, you will have one week to review the content of your own final project and collect any questions that might arise.  
In the final session, we will discuss all open questions regarding the final project together.  
You have time to submit the final version of your project until **3 September 2025 at 24:00**.

Please make sure to name your submitted file as follows:
**final_thesis_FirstnameLastname_SS2025**
(e.g. final_thesis_AnnaMuster_SS2025)
Avoid using special characters such as ä, ö, ü, or ß.

🔖 *At the top of your Python file, please include your **full name** and **student ID number** as comments.*  
❗ *If either the name or the student ID is missing, points will be deducted.*  

*Example:*
```python
# Name: Anna Muster
# Matrikelnummer: 12345678
```

## 🚀 Final Words

We are looking forward to seeing your creative solutions and final projects!  
Stay curious, keep experimenting — and most importantly, have fun while coding and exploring new ideas.  

Good luck and enjoy the journey!
