#  Your Exercises on ILIAS

To ensure that all exercise submissions are organized, complete, and easy to review, please follow these instructions **exactly**.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on ILIAS with the following naming convention:
   ```
   Lastname_SS_2025
   ```

   🔸 *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson → `Johnson_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create one **subfolder per unit**:
   ```
   unit01
   unit02
   ...
   unit10
   ```

---

## 📄 Naming Your Files

Inside each `unitXX` folder, you must upload:

- Your written answers (text or PDF)  
  File name:
  ```
  unitXX_answers.txt
  ```
  or:
  ```
  unitXX_answers.pdf
  ```

- Your Python scripts for exercises in that unit  
  File names:
  ```
  unitXX_ex1.py
  unitXX_ex2.py
  ...
  ```

🔸 *Example:* For Unit 01:
```
unit01/
│
├── unit01_answers.txt
├── unit01_ex1.py
├── unit01_ex2.py
```

## ✅ Tips for Clean Submission

- Use **clear and consistent formatting** in your text files (you may also submit as `.pdf` if preferred).
- Make sure your **Python files run without errors** before submitting.
- Add **comments** in your code to explain your solution steps.
- Submit **only the required files** – avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.pyc`, cache folders, etc.
