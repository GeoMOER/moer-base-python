## Upload of Your Exercises on ILIAS

All your exercise solutions must be uploaded in the following ILIAS folder:  
**`Submission/SS_2025`**

Make sure your folder and file structure follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth correction and feedback.

---

### 📁 Folder Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on ILIAS with the following naming convention:
   ```
   Lastname_SS_2025
   ```

   🔸 *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson → `JohnsonA_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create **one ZIP file per unit**, named:
   ```
   unit01.zip
   unit02.zip
   ...
   unit10.zip
   ```

3. Each `unitXX.zip` should contain your files for that unit, structured as follows:
   ```
   unitXX__ex(1-X)code.py
   unitXX__exXXcode.py # Bonus 
   ```

---

### 📄 File Naming Guidelines


- Use the following format for written answers and Python code:
  ```
  unitXX_ex(1-X)code.py
  ```
`
  📝 *The .py file should contain all your Python solutions (e.g., from exercises 1 to X) in one script, with the task texts included as comments. Bonus solutions should be saved in a separate file named unitXX__exXXcode.py *
  💬 *Comments and the written answer for Exercise 1 may be written in either German or English.*


---

## ✅ Tips for Clean Submission

- Make sure your **Python files run without errors** before submitting.
- Add **comments** in your code to explain your solution steps.
- Submit **only the required files** – avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.pyc`, cache folders, etc.

---

## 📝  Where to Find Your Feedback

The results of the assignment corrections will be saved as a PDF table in the ILIAS folder:
Hausaufgaben-Feedback

Legend for the table:

- A green cell next to your student ID means that all required exercises from Unit 01 were successfully completed.
- A white “B” inside the green cell indicates that the bonus exercise was also completed successfully.

---

## 💡 Why This Is Important

This structure helps us:
- Quickly navigate through your work,
- Review your solutions fairly and efficiently,
- Give you timely feedback.

And it helps **you** practice good documentation habits, which are essential in real-world projects!
