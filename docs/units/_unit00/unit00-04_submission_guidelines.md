## Upload of Your Exercises on ILIAS

All your exercise solutions must be uploaded in the following ILIAS folder:  
**`Submission/SS_2025`**

Make sure your folder and file structure follow the guidelines below to ensure smooth correction and feedback.

---

### üìÅ Folder Structure

1. **Create a main folder** on ILIAS with the following naming convention:
   ```
   Lastname_SS_2025
   ```

   üî∏ *Example:*  
   If your name is Alex Johnson ‚Üí `Johnson_SS_2025`

2. **Inside this main folder**, create **one ZIP file per unit**, named:
   ```
   unit01.zip
   unit02.zip
   ...
   unit10.zip
   ```

3. Each `unitXX.zip` should contain your files for that unit, structured as follows:
   ```
   unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
   unitXX_ex6.py
   unitXX_ex7.py
   ...

---

### üìÑ File Naming Guidelines

- Use the following format for written answers (as PDF):
  ```
  unitXX_ex1.pdf
  unitXX_ex(1-5).pdf
  ```

- Use the following format for Python scripts:
  ```
  unitXX_ex6.py
  unitXX_ex7.py
  ```

- Make sure your **Python files run without errors** before submitting.
- Add **comments** in your code to explain your solution steps.
- Submit **only the required files** ‚Äì avoid uploading unnecessary files like `.pyc`, cache folders, etc.
