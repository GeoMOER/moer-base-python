## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung").
Both are required for passing the course, but only the latter are graded.

The regular deadline for uploading your unmarked assignment solutions to Classroom is Wednesday at 24:00 (midnight) before the next course session.

üïí Note: If the Thursday session falls on a public holiday, the course will take place one week later. In this case, the assignment deadline also shifts by one week.

### Coding Exercises  
You will regularly complete unmarked assignments in the form of coding exercises and other tasks. Most of these exercises will be worked on during the course, but if not completed in class, they must be submitted by the end of the following Wednesday.  
These assignments help deepen your understanding and are required to pass the course, even though they do not count toward your final grade.

Be aware that it will NOT be sufficient to start working on the assignments the day before the deadline. It will be necessary to solve a lot of disturbing and time-consuming problems in the programming world. So start early!!!

### Final Thesis  
The **Final Thesis** is the only graded deliverable in this course. It challenges you to apply your knowledge to a comprehensive, real-world task. 
Please note that the submission deadline for the Final Thesis is listed in the table below. There will be dedicated time in the course syllabus to support your work, and you are encouraged to make consistent progress throughout.


üìù  The final thesis must be submitted within **six weeks**.  
**Deadline:** **March 5th, 2026 at midnight**.

## Final Grade
Your final grade will be based solely on your **Final Thesis**.

## Instruction summary

1. Please include a short description at the top of each script or function explaining what your code does and what is being calculated.  
2. Inside your code, write meaningful comments to describe each important step, logic, and variable updates.  
3. Clear comments help show your understanding, make your work easier to follow, and improve the overall quality of your code.  
4. üö´ Do not copy any example code directly; always adapt it to your own logic and task requirements.  
5. **Use of ChatGPT or Similar AI Tools**  

   You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar AI tools to support you in solving the assignments.  
   However, you must be able to present and explain your solution to demonstrate that you understand what you have done.  

   If you copy code from ChatGPT or another AI directly (**copy & paste**), you are responsible for:  
   - **Running the program** before submission to ensure it works correctly.  
   - **Removing unwanted formatting** ‚Äì especially special icons or symbols in `print()` statements.  
   - **Checking indentations carefully**, as incorrect indentation will cause errors and unnecessary delays during grading.  

   Code that does not run due to such avoidable issues may result in **point deductions**,  
   as it creates additional overhead for the examiner during evaluation.
