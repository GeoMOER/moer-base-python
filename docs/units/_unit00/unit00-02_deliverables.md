## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter are marked.

### Coding exercises, tasks
Students will need to deliver [unmarked assignments](/moer-base-python/unit10/unit10-01_Intro.html) in form of coding exercises and different tasks on a regular basis within one week. The majority of these exercises will be worked on during the course, but if you do not complete them, you must do so by the end of the following Wednesday.

### Projects
The three projects are the marked deliverables. They challange you with a real-world example. They will be marked based on the evaluation criteria [here](/moer-base-python/unit11/unit11-01_project_guidelines.html). They need to be delivered by the deadlines and there will be time in the course syllabus to work on them together. It might make sense for you to do single bits of them in parallel to the units.


You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar AIs to solve the assignments. However, you need to present your solution to make sure you understand what you have done.

## Final grade
Your final grade will consist of the project portfolio.
You may use the following lines of code for calculating your final grade, for example:

```r
assignment_1 <- 5
assignment_2 <- 6

final_grade <- round(mean(c(assignment_1, assignment_2)))
final_grade
```

Note that you do not have to achieve five points in each assignment.
However, passing the course requires at least five points in regard to your final grade and submitting the unmarked assignments in time.
