In this unit, you'll discover how Python handles structured data using built-in and library-based object types. You will explore different ways to store multiple values efficiently and work with them effectively.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics

- **Lists**  
  Flexible, ordered collections that can hold multiple data types.

- **Arrays**  
  Homogeneous sequences of numbers, optimized for performance via `numpy`.

- **Data Frames**  
  Table-like objects from `pandas`, perfect for structured and labeled data.

- **Matrices**  
  2D numeric data structures, often used in scientific computing.


## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goal

You will be able to create, access, and manipulate structured collections of data using Python lists, DataFrames, matrices, and arrays. Youâ€™ll also understand when to use each type based on the nature of your data and the task at hand.
