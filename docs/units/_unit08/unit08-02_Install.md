Matplotlib is not included in the standard Python installation, so you need to install it first. The most common way is using `pip`.

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## üí° Installing in Visual Studio Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) instead of the Windows shell directly, you can install Matplotlib easily in the integrated terminal:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your Python project folder in VS Code.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the integrated terminal (`Terminal` > `New Terminal`).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure your Python interpreter is selected correctly (check in the bottom-right corner or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter`).
4Ô∏è‚É£ In the terminal, run:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

After installation, you can start writing your Python scripts in `.py` files and use Matplotlib just as you would anywhere else. VS Code will detect the package automatically if the correct interpreter is set.

## üêç Importing Matplotlib

Once installed, you can import Matplotlib in your Python code. Most often, we use the `pyplot` module and import it with the alias `plt`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## ‚úÖ Check Your Installation

After importing, you can check the version to ensure it was installed correctly:

```python
import matplotlib
print(matplotlib.__version__)
```
