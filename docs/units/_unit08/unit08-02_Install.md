## üíª Installing Matplotlib

Matplotlib is not included in the standard Python installation, so you need to install it first. The most common way is using `pip`.

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

If you are using a Jupyter notebook, you might also want to run:

```python
%pip install matplotlib
```

## üêç Importing Matplotlib

Once installed, you can import Matplotlib in your Python code. Most often, we use the `pyplot` module and import it with the alias `plt`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## ‚úÖ Check Your Installation

After importing, you can check the version to ensure it was installed correctly:

```python
print(matplotlib.__version__)
```
